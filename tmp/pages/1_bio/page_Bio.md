### History

I have been developing web sites and mobile applications for twenty years. I experiment with low-power computing, build mechanical keyboards, and contribute to Open Source software. I use React, monorepos, Behavior Driven Development, and Dev-Ops integrations, to engineer user interfaces that scale across multiple teams and products.

In my early career, I focused on accelerating the bleeding edge of the web browser. Data visualization with [Mozilla](https://mozilla.com/) and [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/), Audio Working Group Chair at The [W3C](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/), Educational HTML5 Games Development for The [Concord Consortium](https://concord.org/), Node.js Streaming Platform project lead for Red Bull Studios, wrote about JavaScript animation for popular British tech magazine .NET (no relation to the language). I have spoken about JavaScript APIs and Frameworks at over 20 conferences and meetups, and I organized the [Boston JavaScript Meetup Group](https://concord.org/).

In recent years I have focused on using technology to help solve social problems. I was Software Architect and Scrum Master for web accessibility company, AI Squared, and a Lead Developer for two mobile healthcare apps, Radial Analytics and Mya Health.

On a more personal note, I have been bashing computer keys since I was a wee lad. My Dad joined the dark side, and became a database programmer (for a Japanese education company), and thank God, he brought those glorious machines home where they belonged.

> I'll never forget the day my Dad brought home his WANG Terminal in the 1980s, plugged into phone line and started working remotely.

I started programming back in the early 1980s, making computer games on the beloved [BBC Microcomputer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Micro) - my only escape from the realities of growing up on the wrong side of the tracks. I made an unsung vow back then, to never get too close to a database, just in case I got dragged all the way in.

When I was about 12 years old, my friend's mom paid me to develop a book keeping app for her business. She had a Windows 3.1 PC. I wrote it in [QBasic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic#:~:text=QBasic%2C%20a%20short%20form%20of,which%20are%20based%20on%20QuickBASIC.). And that was my first commercial bug fixing experience.

I began designing and building websites for companies back in 1999 and started mixing interactive HTML5 visualizations with live video performances for London clubs and festivals in 2004.

I studied Music Technology, Production & Performance at Langley College in England, where my teacher jokingly nicknamed me "Doctor Filter", because a) every musician was pre-pending their name with "Dr." back then, (E.g., Dr. Dre), and b), because I would apply [Frequency Cutoff Filters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutoff_frequency) to every channel of the electronic music I produced.

My peers thought this nickname was hilarious, and so it stuck. With an ungodly number of hours playing [Team Fortress 2](http://www.teamfortress.com/) under my belt, my nickname naturally shifted to its present, 1337 form, **"F1LT3R"**.

You can still find some of my music online.
